# Project 1 Milestone 1
## CS490: Guided Design in Software Engineering
This project is to build and deploy a simple “music discovery” web app that shows song(s) from my favorite artist(s) and link(s) to the music and lyrics. The data will be dynamically generated using third-party APIs from Spotify and Genius.

## Spotify API and Python
[The Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) allows applications to fetch lots of awesome data from the Spotify catalog, as well as manage a user's playlists and saved music. Some examples of of info you get are:

    1. Track, artist, album, and playlist metadata and search.
    2. High-level audio features for tracks.
    3. In-depth audio analysis for tracks.
    4. Featured playlists and new releases.
    5. Music recommendations based on seed data.

## Install Requirements
```bash
1. pip install python-dotenv
```
```bash
2. pip install requests
```
